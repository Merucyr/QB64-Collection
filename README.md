# QB64-Collection
Collection of separate QB64 programs I've made

## colour.bas
Mix of some hacky stuff to make neat image generation
Takes in an unchecked RGB input, (0,255)
Can change the constant 0/8 values in the first 2 for loops to add black streaks into the program -> The higher the number the greater the black streak
Can take out or add in the randomize timer in the function to do an interesting line-esque output, otherwise it's wavier
It's relatively commented if you're interested in what tomfoolery is going on in there, just a small fun project
